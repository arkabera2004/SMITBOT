   - **Volume**: Reduced from 0.9 to 0.8 for softer, less harsh sound
   - **Natural Pauses**: Added pauses between sentences for conversational flow

### âœ… Conversation Style Improvements:

1. **Natural Language Patterns**:
   - Uses contractions (I'm, you're, don't, can't)
   - Includes filler words (well, you know, actually, I think)
   - Varies sentence structure and length
   - Casual, friendly expressions

2. **Enhanced System Prompts**:
   - Instructs AI to speak like talking to a friend
   - Encourages warm, engaging, personable responses
   - Promotes natural conversation flow
   - Limits responses to 150 words for better pacing

3. **Improved Response Processing**:
   - Automatically converts formal language to contractions
   - Adds natural speech patterns
   - Processes text for better speech flow

### âœ… Natural Speech Features:

1. **Sentence-by-Sentence Speaking**:
   - Breaks responses into natural chunks
   - Adds 0.2-0.3 second pauses between sentences
   - Creates more conversational rhythm

2. **Friendly Greetings & Messages**:
   - "Hey there! I'm really excited to chat with you today!"
   - "Aw, it was really nice chatting with you!"
   - "Perfect! We're starting fresh now!"

3. **Conversational Error Handling**:
   - "Sorry, I'm having a bit of trouble right now. Could you try asking that again?"

### âœ… Configuration Options:

Updated `.env` file with natural voice settings:
```
TTS_RATE=160          # Slower, more natural speed
TTS_VOLUME=0.8        # Softer volume
PREFERRED_VOICE=natural
TTS_PITCH=0.0         # Natural pitch
TTS_INFLECTION=0.1    # Slight variation
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Result:

The voice assistant now sounds much more like a real person having a casual conversation rather than a robotic text-reader. It uses natural speech patterns, appropriate pauses, and conversational language that makes interactions feel warm and engaging.

### ðŸš€ To Experience the Improvements:

1. **Run the voice test**: `python3 test_voice.py`
2. **Start the natural voice bot**: `python3 voice2voice.py`
3. **Try the enhanced bot**: `cd ollama-bot/src && python3 main.py`

The bot will now sound much more human and natural in its speech patterns!
